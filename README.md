- EmojiPedia, as the name itself conveys that it is  like a wikipedia for all the wonderful emoji's we have. One can easily find Emoji Name, its description and few other things about each and every emoji available to us. This website will have wonders in terms of colors themes, animations and visual graphics.

## Goals We are aiming for...

- Listing every single emoji available to us on the website.
- Adding a search bar for the easily accessing the emoji's.
- Adding a editor which will allow everyone to create their own emoji's and showcase their creativity.

## Featuring it as an API
Once we are ready with the full fledge working website, we will be moving towards our next goal i.e. to make it available as an API. An API that gets you emoji, it's name, it's description, date it was created/made available and many more stuffs.

## Setup and Installation

A common issue many people may face while setting up the project:
Running npm install(or npm i) throws these errors -
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78724676/140306243-bbdf0823-9027-4570-a2c8-7a377c12f481.png)

This occurs due to the mismatch in the versions of node and npm installed on your local machine and the ones used in the project.

### Solution

1. Update NodeJS :
   Download the latest version of Node from it's official website -

```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```

This would overwrite the previous outdated version.

2. Update NPM :
   Open your terminal, type the following command and hit enter -

```
 npm install npm@latest -g
```

This would update npm to it's latest version available.

And you're done!
Run the following commands in the project directory to set up the project.

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
